5 companies from different fields have commissioned us a SPA (Single Page Application).

Each of the teams will be in charge of making an application using the API assigned through Sorto.

#Description

The minimum requirements, a SPA with Vue, responsive design, homepage with its header, footer, and principal list of the elements that can be added in the favorite view, a favorites section, in the favorites page you can delete the added elements, modify the title and, or content, as well as rate through a method of rating each one of the elements, also, on the favorites page, we'll need to maintain the add element option. The final result has to meet the minimum requirements. The HTML, CSS, and JS code should follow good practices. SCRUM must be applied throughout the process.
